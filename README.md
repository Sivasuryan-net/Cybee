 I’m super excited to share one of my favorite projects — an AI-powered Threat Detection System that visualizes real-time network traffic and security events through graph-based analytics! 

 What I built:
--A Graph Dashboard that shows live connections between IP addresses in real time.
--Integrated threat intelligence with anomaly detection and event correlation.
--Backend powered by Python, using NetworkX for graph visualization.
--An Alerts & Events panel that dynamically updates TCP/UDP traffic, threat levels, and severity.
--A sleek, dark-themed frontend dashboard designed for SOC (Security Operations Center) monitoring.

 Goal:
 To create a smart cybersecurity environment capable of detecting malicious behavior and visualizing complex network topologies using AI.

 Tech Stack:
 Python | NetworkX | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Graph Theory | AI Threat Detection
